# 5-volt-smart-television

the idea of a sizeable smart-tv that can run on power supplied by any current usb-charging device (including but not limited to lap-tops, external batteries, usb-chargers in a general sense), an idea, which I herewith consider public and fully attributable to degski, he/her with access to this repo.
